# DoWIII-Camera-Mod
A simple script to adjust the camera in Dawn of War III.

## Installation

1. Download the file (camera.scar) and place it in your DoWIII installation folder.
2. Launch the game in -dev mode.
3. Start a match and open the console (Press Ctrl+Shift+~), then type: dofile("camera.scar")

You can now zoom in and out freely with the scroll wheel (you could see the whole map!). To rotate, press alt+j and alt+k for left and right. You can also adjust the declination by pressing alt+n and alt+m.
